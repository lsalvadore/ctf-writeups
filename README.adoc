= CTF writeups

This repository contains writeups for some of the hacking challenges, rooms and machines that I solved. In some cases I followed partially or completely one or more walkthroughs that I used later to elaborate my own personal solutions.

== Structure

Material is subdivided in the following directories:

* CTFs: solutions for hacking events, including events organized by Hack The Box and Try Hack Me;
* Hack The Box: solutions for machines and challenges released on Hack The Box platform;
* Try Hack Me: solutions for rooms released on Try Hack Me platform.
