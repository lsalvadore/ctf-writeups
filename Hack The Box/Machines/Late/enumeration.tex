\section{Initial enumeration.}
\par We begin by scanning \DomainName{late.htb} for open TCP ports, see listing \ref{late_nmap}.
\begin{listing}
  \tiny
	\input{tcp-all.nmap}
	\caption{\MachineName{Late}: Opened TCP ports.}

\end{listing}
\par A website is running on port 80 and we visit it: we find a link to \url{http://images.late.htb} on the homepage and we add the subdomain to our \FileName{/etc/hosts} file.
\par On \url{http:/images.late.htb} we find an interface claiming to convert images to text. By direct experimentation, we discover that the web application takes the text in the images we upload and returns us a text file with it. Moreover the web interface tells us that it uses Flask.
