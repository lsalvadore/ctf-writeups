\section{Privilege escalation to user.}
\par Since we can read the output of our commands, rather than using our remote code execution to get a reverse shell we can search for an \ProtocolName{ssh} private key. Indeed, we discover that a private key is available at \FileName{/home/svc\_acc/.ssh/id\_rsa}. With the payload in \ref{late_copy-private-key.txt} we can retrieve it. Then, we only need to remove the extra \ProtocolName{html} tags from the downloaded file, set the right permissions (\mintinline{bash}{chmod 600 id_rsa}, assuming the file has been renamed \FileName{id\_rsa}) and we can finally use it to enter the system (\mintinline{bash}{ssh -i id_rsa svc_acc@late.htb}).
