\section{Foothold.}
\par By searching on the web, we easily find an exploit for the \SoftwareName{download-from-files} plugin at \url{https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50287}. As we do not have any information about the plugin version that is installed on the machine, we cannot be sure that it will work, but the fact that the exploit is not much older than the machine suggests that we have good chances to be successful.
\par We prepare a php reverse shell in a file with \ExtensionName{phtml} extension and try to upload it with the exploit, having care to disable ssl certicate validation\footnote{For example, we can do it by addinf a \mintinline{python}{verify=False} parameter to the \mintinline{python}{requests.get} and and \mintinline{python}{requests.post} functions.}: the upload is successful. Then accessing the url of the uploaded file after having started \SoftwareName{nc} to listen on the right port gives us a reverse shell as \UserName{wp\_user}.
