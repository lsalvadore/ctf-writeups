\section{Introduction.}
\par Pwn101 is a challenge room from Try Hack Me that you can find \href{https://tryhackme.com/room/pwn101}{here}. It consists in ten binary exploitation challenges of increasing difficulty.
\par We use the following tools:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \SoftwareName{objdump -s} to read data in binaries;
	\item \SoftwareName{objdump -d} to disassemble binaries.
\end{itemize}
\par Moreover, we add the challenge machine IP in \FileName{/etc/hosts} associated with the domain name \DomainName{pwn101.thm}.
